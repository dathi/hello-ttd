# Sample "to-do" Rails app

Created for a demo of TDD with [http://rubyonrails.org/](Rails), using
[http://rspec.info/](RSpec) and [https://cukes.info/](Cucumber).

See full commit messages for step-by-step description. Where files were changed
by running a command rather than manually, that step will be a separate commit,
with the command(s) listed in the commit message.

To keep things simple, we're not using any additional testing tools apart from
RSpec and Cucumber (apart from Database Cleaner and Capybara, which Cucumber
depends on by default). In a real project, some or all of the following might
be useful:

* [factory_girl](https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_girl) for building test
  data
* [faker](https://github.com/stympy/faker) for more realistic test values
* [SitePrism](https://github.com/natritmeyer/site_prism) to describe your site
  using the [page object model](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/PageObject.html)
  pattern
* [timecop](https://github.com/travisjeffery/timecop) to test time-dependent
  code
* [poltergeist](https://github.com/teampoltergeist/poltergeist) to use
  capybara on pages that use javascript
* [capybara-screenshot](https://github.com/mattheworiordan/capybara-screenshot)
  to automatically open a screenshot of the current page when a test fails

Personally, I'd also use [haml](http://haml.info/) instead of erb for the view
templating, but we're sticking with the default here for simplicity.
